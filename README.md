Submission for the Pygame Community Halloween Game Jam 2022.

1. Download and extract the zip file.

2. Run the executable.

Note:

In the attempt of running for the first time, Windows will warn you about a trojan virus.
That is because the executable is a packaged Python script.
Click on "Run anyway". Make sure all files stay under their set directory.
